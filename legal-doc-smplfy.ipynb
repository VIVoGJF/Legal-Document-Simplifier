      "‚ö†Ô∏è Risks:\n",
      " While this is a relatively straightforward NDA, there are a few clauses that could pose risks for a small business or individual, depending on their specific circumstances:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **\"In the event of a breach of this Agreement, the disclosing party shall be entitled to seek legal remedies, including but not limited to injunctive relief and damages.\"**  This clause is risky because it's very broad.  \"Damages\" are undefined.  A court could award substantial monetary damages, potentially devastating to a small business or individual.  There's no limitation on the amount of damages recoverable. A more protective clause would specify the types of damages and/or limit the amount of damages recoverable.  For example, it could specify \"actual damages\" instead of simply \"damages.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "* **\"The obligations of confidentiality shall remain in effect for a period of three (3) years from the date of disclosure.\"** A three-year period is relatively long.  While reasonable in some situations, it might be overly restrictive for a small business or individual, especially if the information's value diminishes significantly over time.  A shorter term, or a clause allowing for earlier termination under certain circumstances, would mitigate this risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Lack of definition of \"Confidential Information\":** The phrase \"includes but is not limited to trade secrets, financial data, and technical processes\" is somewhat vague.  What constitutes \"financial data\" or \"technical processes\" could be subject to interpretation. A more precise definition tailored to the specific information being protected would be beneficial. Ambiguity here increases the risk of disputes.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Absence of a clause regarding return of confidential information:** There's no mention of what happens to the confidential information after the agreement ends or in case of breach.  The receiving party should be obligated to return or destroy all confidential information upon request or termination of the agreement.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Absence of a severability clause:**  This clause states that if a portion of the agreement is found to be unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect.  Without it, if one part is deemed invalid, the entire agreement could be jeopardized.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, while this NDA provides a basic framework, a small business or individual should seek legal counsel to refine it to better protect their interests by addressing the vagueness and potential for significant financial liability.  They should consider adding clauses specifying damages, defining \"confidential information\" more precisely, establishing a mechanism for returning or destroying confidential information, including a severability clause and potentially shortening the duration of confidentiality obligations.\n",
